Document Process for  Photography Service 
For this project To determine what to include in my project, I interviewed a real freelance photographer and also my friend named Alex who runs a small photography business. During the interview, I asked Alex about the day-to-day tasks they manage and the kind of information they track for clients, services, and payments. The goal for me was to understand the key elements needed to support the operations of a photography business.
From the conversation, I learned more about Alex, learned that he works with many different clients for various types of photography services such as weddings, portraits, events, and product shoots and more. They mentioned how important it is to keep track of client contact details, types of services offered, appointment bookings, and payments received. Based on this, I identified the following essential components for the system:

Clients: such as customer names, phone numbers, and emails.


Services: to describe the different photography packages and their prices.


Bookings: to record which client booked which service, along with date, time, and location.


Payments: to track how much was paid, when, and through which method (cash, card, Venmo).


And so these categories sort of became the foundation for my entity-relationship diagram and database structure. The system is designed to help photographers like Alex stay organized, manage appointments, and easily retrieve information about clients and payments. This process helped me think through real-world needs and translate them into a functional database model.
